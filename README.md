# Sorting Algorithms
### Java-based command-line program that sorts an array of numbers based on one of three sorting algorithms the user picks.
<br>
<p>Algorithms used in this program are <b>counting sort, insertion sort and radix sort.</b> All have to have their own method to work. This can be expanded to add other sorting algorithms.</p>
<br>
<p>Program works by taken the first letter of each algorithm and ask the user to input an array. Then it sorts it using that same algorithm from smallest to largest. Won't sort the arry until a non-integer character is used. Error is thrown if the input for the algorithm choice is not an option.</p>
